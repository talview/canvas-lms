module Lti::Messages
  # A "factory" class that builds an ID Token (JWT) to be used in LTI Advantage
  # LTI Deep Linking Requests. These requests indicate to the launched
  # tool that Canvas expects it to return data via deep linking.
  #
  # This class relies on a another class (LtiAdvantage::Messages::DeepLinkingRequest)
  # to model the data in the JWT body and produce a signature.
  #
  # For details on the data included in the ID token please refer
  # to http://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti-dl/v2p0.
  #
  # For implementation details on LTI Advantage launches in
  # Canvas, please see the inline documentation of
