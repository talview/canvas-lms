/**
 * Appends breadcrumbs to the default breadcrumbs that are set in window.ENV.breadcrumbs.
 * This is useful for dynamically adding breadcrumbs to a page that are not part of the default breadcrumbs.
 *
 * @note This should only be used by a single component within the render tree, otherwise the last
 *       component to render will overwrite the breadcrumbs set by the previous component. If you need
 *       to append breadcrumbs from multiple components, you should use the `useAppendBreadcrumbs` hook in
 *       combination with this hook.
 * @link { import('./useAppendBreadcrumbs').useAppendBreadcrumbs }
 * @param breadcrumbs - The breadcrumbs to append to the default breadcrumbs.
 * @param enabled - Whether or not to append the breadcrumbs. This is useful for conditionally appending breadcrumbs,
 * such as for gating changes behind a feature flag or only appending if data has been loaded from the server.
